IMPORTANT: You are free to edit any of my code.
However, your player must work with the original version of my GameEngine

----------------

Your AI player can be composed of many files.
However, please do not create your own files called "GameEngine.py" or "GameRules.py"

(If your player uses a modified version of GameRules.py, please give your version a different name ... It makes the professor's life easier)

----------------

You can run a game between two players with the command:

python GameEngine.py Alice Bob

... replace Alice and Bob with the names of your players

... The GameEngine assumes that any player Eve has a main file Eve.py

---------------

The GameEngine creates logfiles.
(You way want to edit the GameEngine to change the logfile names)

Once you have a logfile, you can watch the game in your web browser with the command:

python VisualGame.py game0.log

... replace game0.log with the logfile of the game you want to watch

... Once VisualGame is running, you can go to your browser and visit:
     http://127.0.0.1:5000/

NOTE: Someday I would like to code up a better interface for watching games ... I realize it is a hassle to have to restart the Flask server when you want to switch which game you are watching.

--------------

VisualGame uses Flask, if you don't have Flask you can use the command:

pip install flask
